### Featured Project: Movie Recommendation Backend

#### **Overview**

This project focuses on developing a robust backend for a movie recommendation application. The backend provides APIs for retrieving trending and recommended movies, user authentication, saving user preferences, and facilitating user interaction through comments and likes. It emphasizes performance optimization and comprehensive API documentation.

#### **Project Goals**

* **API Creation:** Develop endpoints for fetching trending and recommended movies from a third-party API.
* **User Management:** Implement user authentication using JWT and allow users to save their favorite movies.
* **User Interaction:** Create a system for users to add **comments** and **likes** to movies.
* **Performance Optimization:** Use Redis for caching to improve API response times and leverage asynchronous tasks for long-running operations.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Document all API endpoints using Swagger.

#### **Technologies Used**

* **Backend Framework:** Django
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Caching:** Redis
* **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery & RabbitMQ
* **API Documentation:** Swagger
